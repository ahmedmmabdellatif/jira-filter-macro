app:
  # This application has been registered. The `id` below is the unique identifier
  # assigned by Atlassian to this app. Forge uses this ID to determine which
  # app to update on subsequent deployments. Do not change it unless you re-

  runtime:
    # Specify the Node.js runtime that backs your functions. The runtime name must

modules:
  # Define a Confluence macro module. Forge v12 uses the `macro` key rather than
  # the legacy `confluence:macro` key【799124642826588†L109-L116】. Each macro entry
  # specifies its own resource (for the iframe), resolver function, and optional
  # configuration panel.
  macro:
    - key: jira-filter-replica-macro
      title: Jira Filter Replica
      description: A replica of the native Jira Filter macro.
      # The front‑end bundle that renders the macro. This key must correspond to
      # an entry in the top‑level `resources` section【801528993977902†L93-L98】.
      resource: main-app
      # Backend resolver invoked by the macro. Points to the function module
      # defined below.
      resolver:
        function: main-resolver
      # Define a custom configuration panel for the macro. According to the
      # manifest specification, the object form of `config` must include a
      # `resource` property referencing a static resource and may include a
      # `title`. The `type` field used in the previous manifest is not part of
      # the schema【799124642826588†L108-L128】.
      config:
        title: Configure macro
        resource: macro-config
      # Use the default block layout so the macro renders as a block element in
      # Confluence. This property is optional but explicit declaration improves
      # clarity when debugging macro visibility.
      layout: block

  # Declare function modules. Each function has a key and a handler file.
  function:
    - key: main-resolver

# Static resources used by the macro and its configuration panel. These must be
# declared at the top level rather than under `modules`【801528993977902†L93-L98】.
